College 1st Year Computer Programming 1 Activities

This is a Culminaton of the 1st year Computer Prgramming activities

ComProg1 uses a Linux VM and the Programming Language `C`, so we need to setup the Linux VM and how we output `C` Programs.
We will use Ubuntu for the Linux ISO and VirtualBox for the Virtual Machine. Follow [this](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview) tutorial for the Ubuntu VM. 

Please note of the following settings for our case in VirtualBox:
- Change the name of the VM to what you can recognize (i.e. Ubuntu VM _Lastname_)
- Don't create an account using `Unattended Guest OS Install Setup`, skip this part in the tutorial
- Allocate atleast 4GB of RAM, 2 CPU Cores and 25GB of Storage, Check the `Pre-allocate Full Size` option

Follow through the Installation process and make an account with your name and a password that is easy for you to remember.

## Ubuntu Setup
After the installation, setting up Ubuntu for efficient programming is easy and simple. Most Debian-based Linux Distributions have something called appstore (it might be different for other distributions but essentially they have an app where you can install applications), open that and download the following:
- Sublime Text - Sophisticated text editor for code
- Chatbot Client - OpenAI's ChatGPT Website client
- VScode - Visual Studio client for Source Code execution
